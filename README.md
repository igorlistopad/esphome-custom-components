# ESPHome Custom Components

Brings back support for `custom` and `custom_component` to ESPHome after removal of custom components from ESPHome
in the 2025.2.0 release.

The custom components code hosted in this repository is a copy extracted from the [ESPHome][github-esphome] 2024.12.4
release.

The code will be updated as needed to support new releases of the ESPHome.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository is created to support old projects using Custom Components, not recommended for new configurations.\
> Please look at creating a real ESPHome component and "importing" it into your configuration with
> [External Components][esphome-docs-external-components].
>
> You can find some basic documentation on creating your own components at [Developer site][esphome-dev].

## Usage

Add support for custom components into your YAML configuration using
the [external components][esphome-docs-external-components] feature:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://igorlistopad/esphome-custom-components
    components: [custom, custom_component]
```
